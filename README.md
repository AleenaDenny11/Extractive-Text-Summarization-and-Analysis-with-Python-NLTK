# NLTK Text Analyzer & Summarizer

A simple Python project that uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library to perform basic natural language processing (NLP) tasks on text files.  
The project allows users to select a `.txt` file via a dialog box, and then performs:

- Sentence tokenization
- Word tokenization
- Stopword removal and word frequency analysis
- Extractive text summarization based on word frequencies

## Features

- Easy file selection using a graphical dialog box (`tkinter`)
- Cleans and processes text by removing common stopwords
- Displays the most frequent meaningful words
- Generates a concise extractive summary by ranking sentences
